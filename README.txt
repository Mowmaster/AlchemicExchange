Current Versions

v0.1.0.0
World Gen Release
  4 Unique Biomes
  Structures full of Loot and will be needed later to find machines
  8 unique ores containing volital crystals
  8 very colorful trees, the logs and saplings use oreDictionary so they can be used elsewhere.
  Colorful planks, with stair, slab, vertical slab, and fence variants (planks also oreDict'd)
  Colorful stone types (stone, brick, bricks) also with variants like above, and walls too! (stone is also oreDict'd)
  
  This release is the basic world gen the mod will use, the plan is so that previous versions can be updated on worlds so a player can continue to play while the mod updates.
  Having said that, recipes will change as machines and research are introduced, some things easially made available may not be available later without certian requirements or may be replaced all together. ex: [WIP] Crystal Base replacing Crystal Clusters as an asthetic placable item.
  
  
v0.2.0.0
Basic Machine and Research Update
(Supposed Time Frame, before Destiny 2 is released)
  Is planned to contain basic machines and research systems that will be greatly expanded apon later.
